# FFXIV-Cactpot-in-C
Small thing i did trying to recreate the Cactpot mini game from FFXIV using C
## FFXIV Cactpot screenshots and concept
### At first the game gives you a 3x3 matrix and shows you some numbers and hides the others
### Then it lets you reveal some of those numbers
### you then choose a row or a column or a diagonal axe and the sum of your choice is calculated and from that sum the game gives you a score from the scores list on the right
### the goal is to choose the most optimal sum to get a higher score
### it's kind of a gamble but you have nothing to lose so i wouldn't say it's bad ðŸ˜º
